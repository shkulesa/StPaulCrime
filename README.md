# StPaulCrime
I worked on this project along with two teammates. This project is a combination of a RESTful API and a single page application. The RESTful API was written using node.js. The single page application was written using the Vue.js framework. Leaflet and Nominatim were used to make the map and the markers on it. The website displays Saint Paul crime data from the past few years from a copy of the Saint Paul crime data base which can be found <a href="https://information.stpaul.gov/datasets/stpaul::crime-incident-report/about" target="_blank">here</a>. Additionally, incidents can be added as well as deleted from the database using this app. To run the app download the code, install the node module for both the server and ui, and then run each separately. There is a branch with the app bulndled, but the data filters do not work, as the Foundation animations broke upon bundling the project. This project taught me quite a bit about various things. I learned more about RESTful APIs, specifically what the implementation could look like. I also became familiar with Leaflet as well as Nominatim. The primary challenge of this project, however, was learning Vue.js.<br/>

This application could be a useful tool for people with an interest in crime in the city of Saint Paul. The application allows for the filtering of data which makes it possible for the user to search for patterns. This could be useful in the fields of law enforncement. Areas of higher crime could require a larger commitment from law enforcement. The use of this application makes it quick and easy to search for and manipulate desired data. The information it provides could also be important for law makers in a similar way.
